- Push the container image to Azure Container Registry.

Deploy the container image to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Key technologies used** -- Java 11, Docker ,Maven

**Estimated duration**: 30 min

**Lab Type:** Instructor led

## Exercise 1 : Set up your Azure environment

In this exercise, you will use the Azure CLI to create the Azure
resources that will be needed in later units. Using the Azure CLI,
perform the following steps

### Task 1: Authenticate with Azure Resource Manager

1.  Open Gitbash from Desktop and run below command login to the Azure
    portal

    +++az login+++

>**Note**: If see WARNING: A web browser has been opened at `https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize.`Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is
available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with +++az login --use-device-code+++

2.  This command will take you to the default browser to login. Login
    with your Azure subscription account.

3.  Once authenticated switch back to the Gitbash

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image4.jpeg)

4.  Now we will enable our Azure subscription execute the below command

    +++az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"+++

    +++az account list --output table+++

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image5.jpeg)

5.  Define local variables To simplify the commands that will be
    executed further down, set up the following environment variables

    +++export AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP="aztes001_rg_"$RANDOM+++

    +++export AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY="javaaksregist"$RANDOM+++

    +++export AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER="javaakscluster"$RANDOM+++

    +++export AZ_LOCATION="westus"+++

    +++export AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DNS_PREFIX="javaakscontainer"+++

>**Note:** You'll want to replace with your region of choice, for
example: eastus You'll want to replace with a unique value as this is
used to generate a unique FQDN (fully qualified domain name) for your
Azure Container Registry when it is created, for example:
someuniquevaluejavacontainerregistry.

![A computer screen with white and green text Description automatically
generated](./media/image6.jpeg)

>**Note:** This module uses the **jq** tool, which is installed by
default on [***Azure Cloud Shell***](https://shell.azure.com/) to
display JSON data and make it more readable. If you don\\'t want to use
the **jq** tool, you can safely remove the **| jq** part of all commands
in this module.

8.  Next, create a resource group using the following command:

    +++az group create --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP --location $AZ_LOCATION |jq+++

![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image7.jpeg)

9.  Azure Container Registry allows you to build, store, and manage
    container images, which are ultimately where the container image for
    the Java app will be stored. Create an Azure Container Registry with
    the following commands.

    +++az acr create --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY --sku Basic | jq+++

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](./media/image8.jpeg)

10. Configure Azure CLI to use this newly created Azure Container
    Registry

    +++az configure --defaults acr=$AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY+++

![A black background with green and white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image9.jpeg)

11. Authenticate to the newly created Azure Container Registry

    +++az acr login -n $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY+++

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image10.jpeg)

12. Create an Azure Kubernetes Cluster, You'll need an Azure Kubernetes
    Cluster to deploy the Java app (container image) to.

    +++az aks create --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER --attach-acr $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY --dns-name-prefix=$AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DNS_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys | jq+++

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image11.jpeg)

>**Note:** Azure Kubernetes Cluster creation can take up to 10 minutes,once you run the command above, you can optionally let it continue in
that Azure CLI tab and move on to the next unit.

### Task 2 : Run Docker

1.  On the Start menu, click on **DockerDesktop**

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](./media/image12.jpeg)

2.  Make sure its running.

## Exercise 2: Containerize a Java app

In this exercise, you will containerize a Java application.

### Task 1 : Build Java Application

First you will navigate the Flight Booking System for Airline
Reservations repository and cd to the Airlines web application project
folder.

Optionally, if you have Java & Maven installed, you can run the
following command(s) in your CLI to get an sense of the experience in
building the application without Docker. If you do not have Java & Maven
installed, you can safely jump ahead to the next section titled
"Construct a Docker file", In that section you'll use Docker to pull
down Java and Maven to execute the builds on your behalf.

1.  Run the following command in your CLI to navigate to the project.

    +++cd "C:\Labfiles\containerize-and-deploy-Java-app-to-Azure-master\Project\Airlines"+++

![A black background with text Description automatically
generated](./media/image13.jpeg)

2.  Run the following command in your CLI

    +++mvn clean install+++

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image14.jpeg)

>**Note:** The mvn clean install command was used to illustrate then operational challenges of not using Docker multi-stage builds, that we
will cover next. Again this step is optional, either way you can safely move along without executing the Maven command.

3.  Maven should have successfully built the Flight Booking System for
    Airline Reservations Web Application Archive artifact
    FlightBookingSystemSample-0.0.-SNAPSHOT.war, as seen in the
    following image

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](./media/image15.jpeg)

## Task 2 : Construct a Docker file

1.  Within the root of your project,
    containerize-and-deploy-Java-app-to-Azure/Project/Airlines, Create a
    file called **Dockerfile.**

    +++vi Dockerfile+++

![](./media/image16.jpeg)

Add the following contents to Dockerfile and then save and exit

>Note : Copy the code to the Notepad and then copy to the Dockerfile in Gitbash

```
#
# Build stage
#
FROM maven:3.6.0-jdk-11-slim AS build
WORKDIR /build
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
COPY web ./web
RUN mvn clean package

#
# Package stage
#
FROM tomcat:8.5.72-jre11-openjdk-slim
COPY tomcat-users.xml /usr/local/tomcat/conf
COPY --from=build /build/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/FlightBookingSystemSample.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image17.jpeg)

>**Note:** Optionally, the Dockerfile_Solution in the root of your
project contains the contents needed.As you can see, this Docker file
Build stage has six instructions.

## Exercise 3 : Build and run a container image for the Java app

In this unit, you will build and run the container image. As mentioned
earlier, a running instance of an image is a container.

### Task 1 : Build a container image

Now that you've successfully constructed a Dockerfile, you can instruct
Docker to build a container image for you.

>**Note:** Ensure your Docker runtime is configured to build Linux containers. This is important as the Dockerfile being used references
container images (JDK/JRE) for the Linux architecture.

1.  **Docker build** is the command used to build container images.
    The **-t** argument will be used to specify a container label and
    the **.** is the location for Docker to find the Dockerfile. Run the
    following command in your CLI.

>**IMPORTANT** : This lab require jdk 11 . set java_home to jdk 11

    `docker build -t flightbookingsystemsample .`

![A computer screen with text Description automatically
generated](./media/image18.jpeg)

2.  Docker build is something similar

![A screen shot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](./media/image19.jpeg)

>**Note:** As you saw previously, Docker has executed the instructionsnfrom the lines that you've previously written in the prior unit. Each
instruction is a step in sequential order. Rerun the docker build command again, notice the differences in the steps, you'll notice ---\>
Using cache for layers that haven't changed. If your not making app changes (before rerunning the docker build command), then you'll notice
all cached layers as the binaries are untouched and can be sourced from Docker cache). This is an important takeaway when optimizing your
container images and the associated compute costs with time spent
building them.

3.  Docker can also display the available images that are resident. This
    is helpful for viewing what's available to run. Run the following
    command in your CLI

    +++docker image ls+++

You will see something similar:

![](./media/image20.jpeg)

### Task 2 : Run a container image

1.  Now that you have successfully built a container image, you can run
    it.

2.  Docker run is the command used to run a container image. The -p :#### argument will be used to forward localhost HTTP (the first port before the colon) traffic to the container at runtime (the second
port after the colon). Remember from the Dockerfile that the Tomcat app server is listening for HTTP traffic on port 8080 hence that is the
container port that needs to be exposed. Lastly the image tag flightbookingsystemsample is needed to instruct Docker of what image to
run. Run the following command in your CLI:

    +++docker run -p 8080:8080 flightbookingsystemsample+++

You'll see something similar:

![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image21.jpeg)

![A screen shot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](./media/image22.jpeg)

>**Note:** if the command "docker run -p 8080:8080 flightbookingsystemsample" comes up with an error, then use the below
mentioned port

    +++docker run -p 8081:8080 flightbookingsystemsample+++

3.  Open up a browser and visit the Flight Booking System for Airline
    Reservations landing page     at `http://localhost:8080/FlightBookingSystemSample`

    - You should see the following:

![A plane flying in the sky Description automatically
generated](./media/image23.jpeg)

4.  You can optionally sign in with any user from tomcat-users.xml for
    example

Username :  `someuser@azure.com`

Password : `password`

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image24.jpeg)

5.  Leave this git bash instance as it is

## Exercise 4: Push the container image to Azure Container Registry

### Task 1: push a container image to Azure Container Registry

1.  In this task, you will push a container image to Azure Container
    Registry.Azure Container Registry allows you to build, store, and
    manage container images and artifacts in a private registry for all
    types of container deployments. Use Azure container registries with
    your existing container development and deployment pipelines.

2.  Open new instance of Gitbash and run az command to sign into Azure
    portal.

    +++az login+++

3.  Run the following command in your CLI

    +++cd "C:\Labfiles\containerize-and-deploy-Java-app-to-Azure-master\Project\Airlines"+++

4.  We will be using the same Authenticate with Azure Resource Manager
    we have created earlier in the Exercise 1 Task 1.set below variables

    - +++export AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP="aztest001_rg_XXX"+++ ( echo this varaible in 1st instance Gitbash)
    - +++export AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY="javaaksregistXXXX"+++
    - +++export AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER="javaaksclusterXXX"+++
    - +++export AZ_LOCATION=“your resource location”+++
    - +++export AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DNS_PREFIX="javaakscontainer"+++


>**Note:** If your session has idled out, your doing this step at another point in time and/or from another CLI you may have to re
    initialize your environment variables and re authenticate with the following CLI commands.

### Task 2: Push a container image

In this task You can push your newly built container image to the Azure
Container Registry. By doing so, your container image will be network
close to all of your Azure resources, such as your Azure Kubernetes
Cluster. You'll ultimately configure AKS to pull the
flightbookingsystemsample image from Azure Container Registry.

1.  To push the container image to Azure Container Registry, run the
    following three commands in your CLI

2.  Sign in **Azure Container Registry** execute the below command

    +++az acr login -n $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY+++

![](./media/image25.jpeg)

3.  First tag the previously built container image with your Azure
    Container Registry:

    +++docker tag flightbookingsystemsample $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY.azurecr.io/flightbookingsystemsample+++

![](./media/image26.jpeg)

4.  Second, push the container image to Azure Container Registry

    +++docker push $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY.azurecr.io/flightbookingsystemsample+++

![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image27.jpeg)

![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image28.jpeg)

5.  Now view the Azure Container Registry image meta-data of the newly
    pushed image. Run the following command in your CLI

    +++az acr repository show -n $AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY --image flightbookingsystemsample:latest+++

You'll see something similar:

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image29.jpeg)

6.  Container image is now resident within Azure Container Registry and
    ready for deployments by Azure Services such as Azure Kubernetes
    Service.

## Exercise 5: Deploy the container image to Azure Kubernetes Service

In this exercise, you will deploy a container image to Azure Kubernetes
Service.

### Task 1: Deploy a container image

1.  You will deploy this the **flightbookingsystemsample** container image to your Azure Kubernetes Cluster.

2.  Within the root of your project, **Flight-Booking-System-JavaServlets_App/Project/Airlines**,
    Create a file called deployment.yml. Run the following command in your CLI:

    +++vi deployment.yml+++

![](./media/image30.jpeg)

3.  Add the following contents to deployment.yml and then save and exit:

>**Note:** You'll want to update with your AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY environment variable value that was set earlier, Exercise 1 Task1(
AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY= javaaksregist )

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flightbookingsystemsample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flightbookingsystemsample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flightbookingsystemsample
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flightbookingsystemsample
        image: <AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>.azurecr.io/flightbookingsystemsample:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1Gi"
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "2Gi"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flightbookingsystemsample
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: flightbookingsystemsample
```

4.  Press Esc and: and then type `wq` and press enter to save
    the file.

>**Note:** Optionally, the deployment_solution.yml in the root of your project contains the contents needed, you may find it easier to
rename/update the contents of that file.

5.  In the deployment.yml above you'll notice this deployment.yml contains a Deployment and a Service. The deployment is used to
    administer a set of pods while the service is used to allow network access to the pods. You'll notice the pods are configured to pull a
    single image, the \< AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTRY >.azurecr.io/flightbookingsystemsample:latest from Azure Container
    Registry. You'll also notice the service is configured to allow incoming HTTP pod traffic to port 8080, similarly to the way you ran
    the container image locally with the -p port argument.

6.  By now your Azure Kubernetes Cluster creation should have
    successfully completed.

7.  Now configure your Azure CLI to access your Azure Kubernetes Cluster
    via the kubectl command. Install kubectl locally using the az aks
    install-cli command. Run the following command in your CLI

    +++az aks install-cli+++

![](./media/image32.jpeg)

8.  Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the az
    aks get-credentials command. Run the following command in your CLI

    +++az aks get-credentials --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AZ_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER+++

- You will see something similar:

![](./media/image33.jpeg)

9.  Now instruct Azure Kubernetes Service to apply deployment.yml
    changes to your cluster. Run the following command in your CLI

    +++kubectl apply -f deployment.yml+++

- You will see something similar:

![](./media/image34.jpeg)

10. Now use **kubectl** to monitor the status of the deployment. Run the
    following command in your CLI

    +++kubectl get all+++

- You will see something similar:

![A computer screen with text and numbers Description automatically
generated](./media/image35.jpeg)

>**Note:** You'll want to substitute the ip address in the following, 20.81.13.151, with that of your EXTERNAL-IP and note down the POD name,
we will be using that in the next steps.

11. If your **POD** status is **Running** then the app should be
    accessible.

12. You can view the app logs within each pod as well. Run the following
    command in your CLI

    +++kubectl logs pod/flightbookingsystemsample-+++

![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./media/image36.jpeg)

![A computer screen with white text Description automatically
generated](./media/image37.jpeg)

13. Now use the **EXTERNAL-IP** from your kubectl get services
    flightbookingsystemsample output to access the running app within
    Azure Kubernetes Service.

>**Note:** You'll want to substitute the ip address in the following, 20.81.13.151, with that of your EXTERNAL-IP from the command you
previously executed.

14. Open up a browser and visit the Flight Booking System Sample landing
    page at `http://YOUR IPCON:8080/FlightBookingSystemSample` (update
    with your external IP address )

    - You'll see something similar:

![A plane flying in the sky Description automatically
generated](./media/image38.jpeg)

>**Note:** You can optionally sign in with any user from tomcat-users.xml for example someuser@azure.com: password

### Task 2 : Clean Up Resources

1.  Navigate back to Azure portal tab and click on Resources.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically

**Summary:** Congratulations! We have containerized and deployed a Java
app to Azure Kubernetes Service. As part of the lab we containerized a
Java app, push the container image to Azure Container Registry, and then
deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service.
