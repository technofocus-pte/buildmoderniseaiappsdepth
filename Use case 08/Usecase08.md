# Usecase 08 - Building and deploying Contoso Real Estate chat app to support customers.

**Objective**

This usecase demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation
pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure AI Search for data indexing and retrieval.

The usecase includes sample data so it's ready to try end to end. In this sample application we use a fictitious company called Contoso Real
Estate, and the experience allows its customers to ask support questions about the usage of its products. The sample data includes a set of
documents that describe its terms of service, privacy policy and a support guide.

The application is made from multiple components, including:

- **Search service**: the backend service that provides the search and
  retrieval capabilities.

- **Indexer service**: the service that indexes the data and creates the
  search indexes.

- **Web app**: the frontend web application that provides the user
  interface and orchestrates the interaction between the user and the
  backend services.

- Chat and Q&A interfaces

- Explores various options to help users evaluate the trustworthiness of
  responses with citations, tracking of source content, etc.

- Shows possible approaches for data preparation, prompt construction,
  and orchestration of interaction between model (ChatGPT) and retriever
  (Azure AI Search)

- Settings directly in the UX to tweak the behavior and experiment with
  options

- Optional performance tracing and monitoring with Application Insights

**Key technologies used** -- Azure OpenAI Service, ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure AI Search

**Estimated duration --** 40 minutes
